Pearson correlation measures linear relationships, while Spearman and Kendall's measure monotonic relationships (whether the variables tend to increase or decrease together, not necessarily at a constant rate)."

However, recent shifts in customer behavior and credit risk profiles have prompted the Board of Directors to revisit the underlying factors influencing loan approvals and amounts granted. The board is particularly concerned with credit risk, profitability, and data-driven decision-making.\n",

        "During a quarterly strategy meeting, the Chief Risk Officer (CRO) presents a dashboard highlighting inconsistencies in the average loan amounts issued across customer segments. Some applicants with moderate income and lower credit scores are receiving higher-than-expected loan amounts, while more qualified applicants appear to be under-leveraged.\n",

        "\n",
        "\"Among all the customer attributes we’ve been collecting—like income, credit score, employment history, age, debt-to-income ratio, and education level—can we clearly identify which of these factors have the strongest statistical relationship with the loan amount issued?\"\n",

        "1. Identify which factors most strongly drive loan amounts.\n",

        "2. Distinguish between statistically significant vs. insignificant variables.\n",
